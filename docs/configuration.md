# Configuration Reference

PipeRouter is configured by a single YAML file (default: `piperouter.yaml`, override with `--config`). The file is the **single source of truth**: there is no database, and everything the WebUI edits is written back to this file.

Check a file without starting the server:

```bash
piperouter validate --config piperouter.yaml
```

`validate` prints `configuration valid` and exits `0`, or lists **every** problem (one per line) and exits `1`.

## Parsing rules

- Parsing is **strict**: unknown fields are rejected — including inside a route's `options` block. A typo like `stript_prefix` fails the load instead of being silently ignored, and a proxy-only option on a `static` route is an error rather than dead weight.
- `version` is required and must be `v0.3` (see [Schema versions](#schema-versions-and-migrating-from-v1)).
- Durations are YAML strings in Go duration syntax: `10s`, `1m30s`, `500ms`.
- Booleans and integers left unset get the documented default. A duration set to `0s` (or left unset) also falls back to its default — timeouts cannot be disabled.

## Schema versions (and migrating from v1)

The configuration schema version tracks the **application release series that introduced it** (`v0.3`, `v0.4`, ...), not every release: a release that doesn't change the schema keeps accepting the previous version string. This binary reads exactly `version: v0.3`.

There is **no automatic migration**. A file written for another schema version is rejected at load with a hint; migrate it by hand and restart. Migrating from the legacy `version: 1` schema is mechanical:

1. `version: 1` → `version: v0.3`.
2. In every route, move the type-specific fields into an `options:` block. Shared matching fields (`name`, `enabled`, `type`, `prefix`, `match`) stay at the top level:
   - **proxy** routes: `target`, `transport`, `strip_prefix`, `strip_forward_headers` move into `options:`.
   - **static** routes: `target: <path>` becomes `options: { file: <path> }` — note the rename to `file`.

```yaml
# v1 (legacy)                          # v0.3
- name: api                            - name: api
  type: proxy                            type: proxy
  prefix: /v1                            prefix: /v1
  target: https://api.example.com/v1     options:
  strip_prefix: true                       target: https://api.example.com/v1
  transport: jp-proxy                      strip_prefix: true
                                           transport: jp-proxy

- name: landing                        - name: landing
  type: static                           type: static
  prefix: /                              prefix: /
  target: /var/www/index.html            options:
                                           file: /var/www/index.html
```

Everything outside `routes[]` (server, runtime, network, transports) is unchanged from v1 except the `version` value itself.

```

## Field reference

### Top level

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | string | yes | — | config schema version; must be `v0.3` |
| `server` | object | no | see below | listeners |
| `runtime` | object | no | see below | logging |
| `network` | object | no | see below | outbound timeouts |
| `transports` | list | no | `[]` | outbound proxy links |
| `routes` | list | no | `[]` | prefix routes |

### `server.proxy`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `listen` | string | `":8080"` | data-plane listen address (`host:port`; empty host binds all interfaces) |
| `tls.enabled` | bool | `false` | serve HTTPS on the proxy listener |
| `tls.cert_file` | string | `""` | PEM certificate chain; required (non-empty) when `tls.enabled: true` |
| `tls.key_file` | string | `""` | PEM private key; required (non-empty) when `tls.enabled: true` |

The certificate is loaded at startup; an invalid cert/key pair prevents the proxy listener from starting. PipeRouter does **not** do ACME or renewal — see [deployment.md](deployment.md) for the recommended Caddy-in-front setup.

### `server.admin` and `server.web`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `admin.enabled` | bool | `true` | run the admin API (and, with it, the WebUI) |
| `admin.listen` | string | `"127.0.0.1:9090"` | admin listen address; **loopback by default — there is no authentication** |
| `web.enabled` | bool | `true` | serve the embedded WebUI from the admin server |

With `admin.enabled: false` the admin API and WebUI are off; the proxy keeps running and the config can still be managed by editing the file (hot reload stays active). `web.enabled` has no effect while the admin server is disabled. Binding the admin listener to a non-loopback address logs a prominent security warning.

### `runtime`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `log_level` | string | `"info"` | application log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` |
| `recent_logs` | int | `1000` | capacity of the in-memory access-log ring buffer shown in the WebUI; `0` disables it; must be ≥ 0 |

The ring buffer overwrites the oldest entries when full and is cleared on restart. Nothing is written to disk. Structured logs go to stdout.

Ring entries record method, path (never the query string), status, duration, transport and stream kind — plus, when the client sent any, its forward headers (`Forwarded`, `Via`, `X-Forwarded-*`; values capped at 256 characters). Forward headers are captured even on routes that strip them from the outbound request, so the WebUI always shows the original client. No other header values, and never any bodies, are recorded; header values never go to stdout.

### `network` — timeouts

Global outbound tuning, shared by all transports. There is deliberately **no overall request deadline**: response bodies may stream for hours (SSE, large downloads) without being cut off.

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dial_timeout` | `10s` | maximum time to establish a TCP connection (including via a proxy) |
| `tls_handshake_timeout` | `10s` | maximum time for the TLS handshake with the upstream |
| `response_header_timeout` | `120s` | maximum wait for the upstream's response **headers** after the request is sent; exceeding it returns `504` |
| `idle_connection_timeout` | `90s` | how long pooled idle connections are kept before being closed |

Values are Go duration strings. Unset or `0s` means the default.

### `transports[]`

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | yes | unique; must match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}`; `direct` is reserved |
| `type` | enum | yes | `http` or `socks5` |
| `url` | string | yes | proxy URL; scheme must match the type (`http://` for `http`, `socks5://` for `socks5`), must have a host, must **not** contain userinfo (`user:pass@`) |

- The built-in transport **`direct`** (no proxy) always exists, must not be declared, and cannot be modified or deleted.
- `http` transports use a standard HTTP proxy for `http` targets and a CONNECT tunnel for `https` targets. TLS is established end-to-end between PipeRouter and the upstream — the proxy never sees plaintext.
- `socks5` transports dial through a SOCKS5 proxy; hostnames are resolved by the proxy itself.
- Proxy authentication is not supported in v0.1.
- Each transport owns one long-lived connection pool, shared by every route that references it.

### `routes[]`

A route is a **tagged union**: the shared matching fields sit at the top level, and everything specific to the handler type lives in the `options` block, whose schema is selected by `type`. Unknown fields inside `options` are rejected as strictly as top-level ones — a proxy-only option on a `static` route is a load error, not dead weight.

Shared fields (every route):

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | yes | — | unique; must match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}` |
| `enabled` | bool | no | `true` | disabled routes are kept in the file but never match |
| `type` | string | no | `"proxy"` | `proxy` (reverse-proxy) or `static` (serve one local file); selects the `options` schema |
| `prefix` | string | yes | — | path prefix to match; unique across routes (see rules below) |
| `match` | string | no | `"prefix"` | `prefix` (longest-prefix on path-segment boundaries) or `exact` (only a request path **equal** to `prefix` matches — nothing below it) |
| `options` | object | yes | — | type-specific fields, see below |

#### Route type `proxy` (default)

Matches a path, rewrites onto `options.target`, and reverse-proxies over `options.transport`. Omitting `type` is equivalent to `type: proxy`.

`options` for `type: proxy`:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | string | yes | — | absolute `http`/`https` URL (no query, fragment or userinfo) |
| `transport` | string | no | `"direct"` | name of a declared transport, or the built-in `direct` |
| `strip_prefix` | bool | no | `true` | remove the matched prefix before joining with the target path |
| `strip_forward_headers` | bool | no | `true` | remove `Forwarded`, `Via` and `X-Forwarded-For/-Host/-Proto` before forwarding; `false` passes inbound values through unchanged |

#### Route type `static`

Every request that matches is answered with the **same single file** at `options.file`. There is no directory listing, no request-path joining onto the file, and no `file://` URL form.

`options` for `type: static`:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | string | yes | — | filesystem path to a **regular file** — absolute, or relative to the **configuration file's directory** (`..` allowed and may leave that directory; directories and `file://` URLs are not supported) |

**Path resolution (config load / hot-reload only, not per request):**

- Absolute path: used as-is after cleaning — `/var/www/index.html`
- Relative path: resolved against the **directory containing the config file** — with `piperouter.yaml` at `/etc/piperouter/piperouter.yaml`, `file: www/index.html` → `/etc/piperouter/www/index.html`
- `..` is allowed and may resolve **outside** the config directory (`../files/index.html` is fine). This matches absolute paths, which can already point anywhere the process can read. Whoever edits the config is already trusted.
- The YAML is **never rewritten** to an absolute path (so the file stays portable). Only the in-memory route table stores the absolute path for serving.
- Trailing separators and URL schemes are rejected.

Only `GET` and `HEAD` are allowed (`405` otherwise). A missing file yields `404` at request time; if the path exists at validation time it must be a regular file (not a directory).

Typical landing page + API split (longest prefix wins, so `/v1` beats `/`):

```yaml
routes:
  - name: api
    type: proxy
    prefix: /v1
    options:
      target: https://api.example.com/v1
      strip_prefix: true

  - name: landing
    type: static
    prefix: /
    match: exact                # serve the page at "/" only; scanner paths get the plain 404
    options:
      file: www/index.html      # relative to the config file's directory
      # file: /var/www/index.html  # or absolute
```

Omit `match` (or set `match: prefix`) to keep the root route as a catch-all that answers every unclaimed path with the file.

## Validation rules

The loader rejects a configuration (listing **all** problems at once) when any of the following holds:

- `version` is not `v0.3`, or an unknown field is present anywhere (including inside a route's `options` block);
- a route name or transport name is duplicated, empty, or doesn't match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}`;
- a transport is named `direct` (reserved);
- a transport `type` is not `http` or `socks5`;
- a proxy `url` is missing, unparsable, has the wrong scheme for its type, has no host, or contains userinfo;
- a route `type` is not `proxy` or `static` (empty is normalized to `proxy`);
- a route `match` is not `prefix` or `exact` (empty is normalized to `prefix`);
- a route's `options` block does not match its `type` (e.g. `file` on a proxy route);
- a `proxy` route references a transport that doesn't exist (`direct` is always known);
- a route `prefix` is duplicated or violates the prefix rules below;
- a `proxy` route `options.target` is missing, not an absolute URL, not `http`/`https`, has no host, or contains userinfo, a query, or a fragment;
- a `static` route `options.file` is missing, looks like a URL, has a trailing separator, is relative without a config-file base directory, fails to resolve to an absolute path, or (when the resolved path already exists) is not a regular file;
- `tls.enabled: true` but `cert_file` or `key_file` is empty;
- `runtime.log_level` is not one of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`;
- `runtime.recent_logs` is negative.

### Prefix rules

A prefix must:

- start with `/`;
- not contain `?` or `#`;
- not contain empty segments (`//`);
- not contain `..` segments;
- not end with `/` — unless it is exactly the root prefix `/`.

| Prefix | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `/openai` | valid |
| `/` | valid (root — matches everything) |
| `/openai/` | rejected — write `/openai` |
| `openai` | rejected — must start with `/` |
| `/a//b` | rejected — empty segment |

The loader rejects non-canonical prefixes rather than silently fixing them. The WebUI route editor trims a trailing `/` for you before saving.

## Matching semantics

Only **path-prefix** matching exists — no host, method, header, query or regex matching.

A route with `prefix: /openai` matches a request path `P` when:

```text
P == "/openai"   OR   P starts with "/openai/"
```

i.e. matching is **path-segment-boundary aware**:

| Request path | `/openai` matches? |
| --- | --- |
| `/openai` | yes |
| `/openai/` | yes |
| `/openai/models` | yes |
| `/openai2` | **no** |
| `/openai-test` | **no** |

When several routes match, the **longest prefix wins** — the order of routes in the file never affects the result. With prefixes `/api`, `/api/openai` and `/api/openai/v1` configured, a request to `/api/openai/v1/models` always hits `/api/openai/v1`.

The root prefix `/` matches every request (useful as a catch-all; any longer prefix still wins). Disabled routes are skipped entirely.

### `match: exact`

A route with `match: exact` matches **only** a request path equal to its `prefix` — nothing below it:

| Request path | `prefix: /`, `match: exact` matches? |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | yes |
| `/index.html` | **no** |
| `/wp-admin/install.php` | **no** |

Paths that miss an exact route fall through to the remaining routes (and to the 404 below when nothing else matches). This turns a root static route from a catch-all into a single page: scanner probes for `/wp-admin/...`, `/.env` and friends no longer receive your file.

### Unmatched requests

If nothing matches, the client gets a deliberately anonymous 404 — no JSON envelope, no wording, no header or body that identifies PipeRouter, so path scanners learn nothing from it:

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

404
```

The access log and metrics still record these requests as `route_not_found` internally.

## Rewrite semantics

The upstream URL is built from the route's target and the request path:

```text
base  = target path with any trailing "/" removed   (target path "/" → "")
rest  = request path minus the prefix, if strip_prefix   (prefix "/" strips nothing)
      = the full request path, otherwise
final = base + rest;  if empty → "/"
```

Scheme and host always come from the target; the query string is preserved verbatim.

Examples (the third row is the canonical acceptance case):

| Prefix | Target | `strip_prefix` | Request | Upstream receives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/openai` | `https://api.example.com/v1` | `true` | `/openai` | `https://api.example.com/v1` |
| `/openai` | `https://api.example.com/v1` | `true` | `/openai/` | `https://api.example.com/v1/` |
| `/openai` | `https://api.example.com/v1` | `true` | `/openai/chat?stream=true` | `https://api.example.com/v1/chat?stream=true` |
| `/openai` | `https://api.example.com/v1` | `true` | `/openai/models` | `https://api.example.com/v1/models` |
| `/openai` | `https://example.com/v1` | `false` | `/openai/models` | `https://example.com/v1/openai/models` |
| `/github` | `https://api.github.com` | `true` | `/github/repos/golang/go` | `https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go` |
| `/` | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` | `true` | `/dashboard` | `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard` |

What PipeRouter does **not** touch:

- **Query strings** — passed through byte-for-byte, including parameter order and a bare trailing `?`.
- **Percent-encoding** — `%2F`, `%20` etc. are never decoded, re-encoded or "cleaned"; the rewrite works on the escaped path.
- **Duplicate slashes** and other legal path oddities inside the remaining path.
- **Method, body, ordinary headers** — forwarded as-is (hop-by-hop headers such as `Connection`, `TE`, `Transfer-Encoding` are handled per the HTTP spec; WebSocket upgrades are preserved).

Two deliberate exceptions to full transparency:

- `Host` is always set to the **target's** host (there is no `preserve_host` option in v0.1).
- PipeRouter adds **no** `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `Forwarded` or `Via` headers — and by default it **removes** inbound ones (`strip_forward_headers: true`), so a fronting reverse proxy such as Caddy or nginx never leaks the real client IP or your public hostname to the target. Set `strip_forward_headers: false` on a route to pass the inbound values through unchanged (useful when the target is your own service and needs the client IP). Stripped or not, inbound forward headers are still captured in the in-memory access log, so the WebUI keeps showing the original client.

## Error mapping

Upstream HTTP responses — including `401`, `404`, `429`, `500` — are relayed **unchanged**. PipeRouter generates its own response only when it cannot get one from the upstream:

| Condition | Status | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No route matched the request path | `404` | plain-text `404` — deliberately carries no fingerprint at all; logged internally as `route_not_found` |
| Static route received a method other than GET/HEAD | `405` | `{"error":"method_not_allowed"}` (also sets `Allow: GET, HEAD`) |
| DNS failure, connection refused/failed, dial timeout, HTTP-proxy CONNECT failure, SOCKS5 negotiation failure, TLS handshake failure, upstream closed the connection before responding | `502` | `{"error":"upstream_connection_failed"}` |
| Upstream connected but response headers didn't arrive within `network.response_header_timeout` | `504` | `{"error":"upstream_timeout"}` |
| WebSocket upgrade toward the upstream failed | `502` | `{"error":"websocket_upgrade_failed"}` |
| Unexpected internal error (recovered panic) | `500` | `{"error":"internal_error"}` |
| Client canceled the request | — | no response is written (logged as `client_canceled`) |

Static file responses (including a missing file → `404` from the file server) are ordinary HTTP responses, not the JSON error envelope above.

Error bodies are fixed JSON codes; they never leak upstream details, proxy URLs, credentials or file paths (those go to the application log only). There are **no automatic retries** — requests may have side effects, so every failure is reported to the caller immediately.

## Hot reload, revisions and persistence

### Editing the file by hand

PipeRouter watches the configuration file (rename-safe, with a short debounce so editors that write-then-rename work):

- **Valid change** → a new immutable runtime snapshot (route table + transport pools) is built and swapped in atomically. New requests use it immediately; in-flight requests, SSE streams and WebSockets keep running on the old snapshot undisturbed. No restart, ever.
- **Invalid change** → the process keeps serving with the **last valid configuration**, logs the reason, and reports the error through `GET /api/v1/status` (`config.valid: false` + `last_error`); the WebUI shows a persistent banner. PipeRouter never exits because of a bad config edit.

Listener addresses (`server.proxy.listen`, `server.admin.listen`) and proxy TLS settings cannot be re-applied without interruption — changing them requires a restart. Routes, transports, log level and log capacity hot-reload.

### Editing through the WebUI / Admin API

Every write goes through the same pipeline: apply change → full validation → build new snapshot → write a temp file in the same directory → `fsync` → back up the previous file to `<config>.bak` → atomic rename → swap the snapshot. A failed write leaves both the file and the running configuration untouched and returns a structured error.

### Revisions and concurrent edits

Each configuration content has a revision, `sha256:<hex>` of its canonical YAML form. Reads (`GET /api/v1/config`, route/transport GETs) return the current revision; mutating requests can carry it back in the JSON body. If the configuration changed in the meantime — another API client, or a hand edit picked up by the watcher — the API answers `409 Conflict` (`revision_conflict`) instead of overwriting, and the WebUI prompts you to reload. Omitting the revision skips the check.

### YAML caveat (important)

> Saving from the WebUI or Admin API re-serializes the configuration as canonical YAML. **Comments, key order, blank lines and hand formatting are lost.** The previous file content is preserved as `<config>.bak` (one generation only). If you maintain a heavily commented config, treat a copy outside the live path as your master.
